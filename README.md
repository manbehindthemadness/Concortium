# Consortium, a lightweight cross-DAO governance protocol.

## Abstract:

This whitepaper outlines the conceptual framework for Consortium, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance protocol. The proposal aims to guide future developers in building a multi-organization consensus system that operates transparently and openly while leveraging existing node technologies. The key concepts include open-source operations, proof of decentralization, reasonable consensus mechanisms, adaptability, upgradability, ecosystem exclusion functionality, collaborative assistance, philanthropic verification, and participation incentives. Additionally, the protocol envisions implementing a node extension through member networks as the primary membership qualification, eliminating the need for dedicated infrastructure.

## Introduction:

The Consortium protocol establishes a lightweight cross-DAO governance framework that ensures transparency, public accountability, and fair decision-making processes. It operates as a multi-organization consensus system, leveraging existing node technologies to achieve its objectives.

## Protocol Concepts:

### 2.1 Open-Source and Transparent Operations:

All activities within the Consortium protocol must adhere to open-source principles, transparency, and public governance. This ensures visibility and inclusivity for all DAO participants.

### 2.2 Proof of Decentralization:

Voting power within the protocol is determined through proof of decentralization mechanisms. Both proof of stake (POS) and proof of work (POW) qualifications are considered, prioritizing node count over stake ratio for POS and node count over hashrate ratio for POW.*

### 2.3 Provision for Qualifying New Decentralized Technologies:

The protocol accommodates the qualification of new decentralized technologies as they emerge, ensuring inclusivity and adaptability within the ecosystem.

### 2.4 Proposal System and Consensus Mechanisms:

Consortium implements a smart contract-based proposal system with consensus mechanisms designed to facilitate reasonable decision-making among participants.

### 2.5 Ecosystem Inclusion Principles:

Decentralized ecosystems are awarded governance power based on their adherence to decentralized fundamentals. Larger ecosystems cannot gain exclusivity in consensus, while smaller ecosystems should not gain exclusivity in multiplicity.**

### 2.6 Upgradability and Adaptability:

Consortium prioritizes upgradability and adaptability, allowing for the evolution of the protocol to meet changing needs and advancements in technology.

### 2.7 Algorithmic Ecosystem Exclusion Functionality:

The protocol includes functionality to exclude ecosystems that engage in malicious conduct, fail to meet inclusion requirements, or violate contractual agreements through consensus-driven decision-making.

### 2.8 Collaborative Assistance:

Consortium provides collaborative assistance to its participants, including philanthropic verification, legal support, regulatory guidance, compliance audits, and other necessary services.

### 2.9 Philanthropic Organizational Principles:

The protocol embraces philanthropic principles, promoting initiatives such as grants, charters, scholarships, charity, trusts, education, arts, and foundational welfare.

### 2.10 Participation Incentives:

Consortium incentivizes active participation through various mechanisms to drive engagement and ensure a vibrant ecosystem.

## Governance Principles:

### 3.1 Absence of Intrinsic Monetary Value:

The protocol emphasizes that governance within Consortium holds no monetary valuation and derives conceptual value solely from collective security.

### 3.2 Non-Tradable Governance:

Governance within Consortium cannot be bought or sold at any time, ensuring a fair and inclusive decision-making process.

### 3.3 Decentralization by Qualification:

All governance issuance within the protocol is algorithmically qualified, maintaining a balanced distribution of voting power through predetermined guidelines subject to consensual voting.

### 3.4 Utility through Escrow:

The Consortium protocol provides utility through escrow services for documents, extra-ecosystem transactions, notary services, and other miscellaneous intermediary functions.

### 3.5 Assurance of Autonomy:

The Consortium protocol ensures that all participants within the DAO maintain their autonomy within their respective ecosystems. This autonomy extends to their actions and decision-making processes, except in cases where those actions directly or indirectly harm other participants or the overall governance protocol.

### 3.6 Assurance of Non-Aggression:

Consortium provides a robust assurance of non-aggression among all DAO participants. This assurance grants participants exemption from any hostile actions originating from other participants, with the exception of actions driven by innovation within a free market.

### 3.7 Collaborative Incentives:

In instances where conflicts or potential harm arise among DAO participants, the Consortium protocol incentivizes the involved parties to actively pursue collaborative relationships within an organizational unit.

## 3.8 Extensible interfaces:
The Consortium protocol incorporates extensible interfaces that facilitate the submission of proposals by external parties who are not members of the protocol. These third parties may include entities specializing in general innovations, compliance, regulation, bug identification, and problem resolution. 

## Tokenomics:
None.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Consortium protocol embodies a forward-thinking governance framework tailored for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). It embraces principles of transparency, collaboration, adaptability, philanthropy, and fair decision-making to foster a robust and inclusive ecosystem that empowers participants and upholds collective security and value preservation. A vital prerequisite of the protocol is the attainment of prior agreement and consensus among multiple DAOs, determined within their individual governance systems. This emphasis on inter-DAO collaboration ensures a harmonious and cooperative environment, bolstering the protocol's effectiveness and success.
By leveraging existing node data infrastructure, the protocol enhances its versatility as it is implemented by the native developers of each participating DAO. This approach underscores the commitment to collective decision-making and mutual agreements among multiple DAOs, holders, and developers before the protocol's implementation, solidifying its collaborative nature and reinforcing the principles of decentralized governance.


*Note: This whitepaper is entirely conceptual and serves as a guide for future developers. The statements herein provide an outline for the proposed governance protocol and its fundamental principles.*

**Note: Clarify the meaning of "POS qualification through node-count over stake ratio" and "POW qualification through node-count over hashrate ratio" for accurate representation.*

***Note: Specify the requirements and process for failing to meet inclusion requirements, as well as the exclusion via consensus mechanism to ensure clarity and completeness of the proposal.*

***Note: Ensure inclusion requirements are reasonable goals or produced in a tiered system.*

****Note: Define the concept of multi-DAO organizational units and the incentives therein.*
